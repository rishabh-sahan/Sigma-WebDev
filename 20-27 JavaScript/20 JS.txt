What is a Variable ?
A Variable is simply the name of a storage location

Ex: 
age = 23
age -> Variable, 23 -> Value

name = "rishabh"
name -> Variable, rishabh -> Value

Data Types in JS
Primitive Types
    Number, Boolean, String, Undefined, Null -> Widely Used
    Bigint, Symbol -> Rarely Used

Numbers in JS
Positive(14) & Negative(-4)
Integers(45, -50)
Floating number - with decimal (4.6, -8.9)

Operation in JS
addition = a + b
subtraction = a - b
multiplication = a * b
division = a / b
modulo = a % b (remainder operator)
exponentiation a**b (power operator)

NaN in JS
The NaN global property is a value representing Not-A-Number
0/0, NaN-1, NaN*1, NaN+NaN, NaN/NaN, NaN+1

Operator Precendence
This is the general order of solving an expression
    Note: From Left to Right Priority
()
**
*, /, %
+, -

Ex: (5+2)/7+1*2
    (7)/7+1*2
    1+1*2
    1+2 = 3

    (2+1)*3
    3*3 = 9

    3/1+2**2
    3/1+4
    3+4 = 7

    4+1*6/2
    4+6/2
    4+3 = 7

let keyword
Syntax of declaring variables
Ex:
let age = 20;
age = age + 1;

const keyword
values of constants can't be changed with re-assignment & they can't be re-declared
Ex:
const pi = 3.14;

var keyword
Old syntax of writing variables
Ex:
var age = 23;
var cgpa = 8.5;

Assignment Operators
age = age + 1 -> age += 1
age = age - 1 -> age -= 1
age = age * 1 -> age *= 1
age = age / 1 -> age /= 1
age = age % 1 -> age %= 1

Unary Operators
++age, --age -> Pre-increment (Change, then use)
    let age = 10;
    let newAge = ++age;
age++, age-- -> Post-increment (Use, then change)
    let age = 10;
    let newAge = age++;

Identifier Rules
All JS variables must be identified with unique names (identifiers)

* Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
    (no space); a-z, A-Z, _, $
* Names must begin with a letter.
    let age;
* Names can also begin with $ and _.
    let _age; let $age;
* Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
* Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) CANNOT be used as names.

camelCase
Way of writing identifiers

camelCase (JS naming convention) -> let rishabhJain;
snake_case -> let rishabh_jain;
PascalCase -> let RishabhJain;

Boolean in JS
Boolean represents a truth value -> true or false / yes or no

What is TypeScript ?
Static Typed, where is JS is dynamic typed
Designed by Microsoft

String in JS
Strings are text or sequence of characters

String Indeices
index = position
0 based indexing 
    let name = "RISHABH JAIN";
    name[0] -> 'R'
    name[1] -> 'I'
    name[7] -> ' '
    name.length -> 12

Concatenation
adding strings together 

null & undefined in JS
undefined -> A variable that has not been assigned a value is of typed

null -> The null value represents the intentional absence og any object value.
