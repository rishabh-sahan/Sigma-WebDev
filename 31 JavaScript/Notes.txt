Call Stack -> It is a Last In First Out (LIFO) Data Structure

Promises -> The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value
    resolve & reject
    resolve -> Succes Callback

Promises are rejected and resolved with some data (valid results or errors)
