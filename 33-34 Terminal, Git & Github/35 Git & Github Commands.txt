Configuring Git
git config --global user.name "My Name"
git config --global user.email "someone@email.com"
git config --list

Basic Commands
clone -> Cloning a repositry on our local machine = git clone <repo-link>
status -> Displays the state of the code = git status

ls -la = to see hidden files in the folder

add -> adds new or changed files in your working directory to the git staging area = git add <file-name>
    git add . -> entire codebase is staged 

commit -> it is the record of change = git commit -m "some message"
push -> upload local repo content to remote repo = git push origin main 

init -> used to create a new git repo = git init

git remote add origin <repo-link>
    link of the repo where the files need to be stored or pushed
git remote -v -> to verify remote
git branch -> to check branch
git branch -M main -> to rename branch
git push origin main 

git push -u origin main 
    if we use -u once means then again we dont need to mention origin main
    -u -> upstream
    git main 

Branch Commands

git branch -> to check branch
git branch -M main -> to rename branch
git check out <branch-name> -> to navigate
git checkout -b <new-branch-name> -> to create new branch
git branch -d <branch-name> -> to delete branch

git checkout main -> to comeback to main branch

Merging Code 
git diff <branch-name> -> to compare commits, branches, files & more
git merge <branch-name> -> to merge 2 branches
    OR
Create a PR (Pull Request)

Pull Request -> It lets you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub 
PR Merge is also Commit 

git pull origin main -> used to fetch and download content from a remote repo and immediately update the local repo to match that content

Merge Conflicts -> An event that takes place when git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits

Fixing Mistakes
Case 1: Staged changes
    git reset <file-name>
    git reset

Case 2: commited changes (for one commit)
    git reset HEAD-1

case 3: commited changes (for many commits)
    git reset <commit-hash>
    git reset --haard <commit-hash>
