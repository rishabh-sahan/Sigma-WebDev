Object Oriented Programming
To Structure our code
    prototypes
    new operators
    constructors
    classes
    keywords (extends, super)

Object Prototypes
Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.
It is like a single template object that all objects inherit methods and properties from without having their own copy.

arr.__proto__ (reference)
Array.prototype (actual object)
String.prototype

Factory Functions
A function that creates objects 

New Operator
The new operator lets developers create an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of the built-in object types that has a construcutor function

classes
Classes are a template for creating objects
The constructor method is a special method of a class for creating and initializing an object instance of that class

Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism that allows us to create new classes on the basis of already exisitng classes
