    UNIQUE -> all values in column are different
    DEFAULT -> sets the default value of a column
    CHECK -> it can limit the values allowed in a column

    PRIMARY KEY -> makes a column unique & not null but used only for one
    FOREIGN KEY -> prevent actions that would destroy links between tables

What are Keys ?
    Keys are special columns in the table

Primary Key
    It is a column (or set of columns) in a table that uniquely identifies each row. (a unique id)
    There is only 1 PK & it should be NOT NULL

Foreign Key
    A foreign key is a column (or set of columns) in a table that refers to the primary key in another table
    FKs can have duplicate & null values
    There can be multiple FKs
