Where Clause
    To define some conditions

Operators
    Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %
    Comparision Operators: =, !=, >, >=, <, <=
    Logical Operators: AND, OR, NOT, IN, BETWEEN, ALL, LIKE, ANY
    Bitwise Operators: &, |

Frequently used Operators
    AND: to check for both conditions to be true
    OR: to check for one of the conditions to be true
    BETWEEN: selects for a given range
    IN: matches any value in the list
    NOT: to negate the given condition

Limit Clause
    Sets an upper limit on number of (tuples) rows to be returned

Order by Clause
    To sort in ascending (ASC) or descending order (DESC)

Aggregate Functions
    Aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values, and return a single value
    COUNT()
    MAX()
    MIN()
    SUM()
    AVG()

Group by Clause
    Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows.
    It collects data from multiple records and groups the result by one or more column.
    *Generally we use group by with some aggregation function 

Having Clause
    Similar to where i.e. applies some condition on rows.
    But it is used when we want to apply any condition after grouping

    WHERE is for the table, HAVING is for a group
    Grouping is necessary for HAVING

General Order
    SELECT column(s)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
    GROUP BY column(s)
    HAVING condition
    ORDER BY column(s) ASC;

Table Queries
    Update (to update existing rows)
    Delete (to delete existing rows)
    Alter (to change the schema)
    ADD Column
    DROP Column
    RENAME Table
    CHANGE Column (rename)
    MODIFY Colum (modify datatype/constraint)
    Truncate (to delete table's data)
