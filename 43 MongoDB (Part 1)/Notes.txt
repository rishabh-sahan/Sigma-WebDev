BSON Data
    Binary JSON

JSON vs BSON
    JSON and BSON are close cousins as their nearly identical names imlpy

JSON
    Text based
    Space inefficient
    Encoding: UTF-8 String
    Data Support: String, Boolean, Number, Array, Object, null
    Readability: Human and Machine

BSON
    Encoding: Binary
    Data Support: String, Boolean, Number(Integer, Float, Long, Decimal128...), Array, null, Date, BinData
    Readability: Machine only

Collections
    Document: Mongo stores data in form of documents (BSON docs)
    Collection: MongoDB stores document in collections.

INSERT in DB
insertOne
    db.collection.insertOne()

    show collections //to see data in the database

Ex:
    db.student.insertOne({ name: "Rishabh", marks: 80})
    db.students.find()
If a collection does not exist, MongoDB creates the collection when you first store data for that collection.

insertMany(array of documents)
db.collection.insertMany() //Inserts multiple documents into a collection.
Ex:
    db.student.insertMany([{ name: "Rishii", marks: 88}, {name: "Abhi", city:"Mandya"}])
