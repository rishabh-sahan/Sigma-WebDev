Mongoose
A library that creates a connection between MongoDB and Node.js Javascript Runtime Environment.
It is an ODM (Object Data Modeling) Library.

npm i mongoose 

Schema
    Schema defines the shape of the documents within that collection

Models
    Model in mongoose is a class with which we construct documents.

INSERT
Inserting One
Inserting Multiple

Note
Mongoose uses Operation Buffering
Mongoose lets start using your models immediately, without waiting for mongoose to establish a connection to MongoDB.

FIND
Model.find() //returns a Query (thennable)
*Mongoose Queries are not promises. But they have a .then()

Model.findOne() //returns a single result
Model.findById() //commonly used

UPDATE
Model.updateOne()
Model.updateMany()

Model.findOneAndUpdate()
Model.findByIdAndUpdate()

DELETE
Model.deleteOne() //return count
Model.deleteMany() //return count

Model.findByIdAndDelete()
Model.findOneAndDelete()

Schema Validations
