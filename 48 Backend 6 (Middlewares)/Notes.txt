Middleware
    It is an intermediary
        Request -> Middleware -> Response

in Express
    Middleware in Express are functions that come into play after the server receives the request and before the response is sent to the client.

Common middleware functions:
    * methodOverride (Ex: GET, POST -> PUT, DELETE)
    * bodyParser 
    * express.static
    * express.urlencoded

What do middlewares do?
Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
    * Execute any code.
    * Make changes to the request and the response objects.
    * End the request-response cycle.
    * Call the next middleware function in the stack.
